    <p> How I adore frogs! They rush and scramble through the yellow bushes in front of my house; barely can I keep up with them. Many a night I spent chasing their croaks and wheezes, only to be greeted by silence and moist earth. Occasionally, as I scale the hills in front of my home, I find their bleached skeletons; it does me a great deal of pain to see them. For the ones I find alive, their wart-covered and squishy bodies keep my hands at bay. I'm content with watching them slip around. A bit of a tangent, but I've only ever seen them in the evening or at night (one such frog was deformed and living underneath a plastic pond someone put out). Of course you would assume this to be reasonable-frogs are quite pleased with cooler light. For quite a few years I assumed the same! Yet a tiny yellowish frog I met was more than eager to skitter around in the morning. I often checked up on him in his little frontyard hole. He made me question the limits of frogs, their personalities even! I should begin naming the ones I find. For instance, there was one large frog I discovered in a gorge one day, next to an abandoned plane part. He was a beauty, I was completely immersed in his Jovian eyes and matte-green back. I named him 'Toasty,' partly because he gave off a toasty vibe and partly because I stared at him for so long I forgot about my toaster being on back at home and arrived to a black chunk of inedible ash (formerly wheat bread).

    <p> Special mention: <a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/frequently-asked-questions-about-deformed-frogs">Minnesota Deformed Frogs</a> </p>
      
    <ul> 
        
    <li> Minnesota began having instances of deformed frogs beginning in 1993, yet the real frenzy began in 1995 when deformities were sighted in a surprising number of frogs in a wetland near Henderson. Soon plenty of these frogs were seen all over the Minnesota River Valley. A cause for the perplexing problems isn't yet known. </li>
        
    <li> Most frogs have deformities of the hind legs, or no hind legs at all. Sometimes there is a distinct lack of muscle, and other times there are a tangle of limbs that flop behind the frog. These deformities are accompanied by lots of digestive and reproductive problems; it's no surprise that many of these frogs can't survive past winter. </li>
        
    <li> The deformities aren't selective; salamanders, treefrogs, American toads, and bullfrogs are among those affected. But this case largely affects just local frog populations. </li>
        
    <li> It's been speculated that the deformities stem from well water. However, the MPCA (Minnesota Pollution Control Agency) and university scientists still don't know the true cause. The MPCA and its partners worked from 1998 until 2001, when their funding was cut off. </li>

     <h3 align="center"> ↴ Why I love toads ↴</h3>
    <p> When I first came to my secluded mountain neighborhood at 7 years old, I cared much more about the bunnies and deer than any toad. The ideal conditions for toad watching consisted of peak mosquito hours, so I rarely ever took a liking to seeking toads out. When I was up and in school they were down in muddy burrows or shifting within bushes. </p>
    
    <p> Yet occasionally I would patter down from my room and see rippling patterns decorating my patio area. I'd find a little toad kicking about in my pool, swishing along for a bit before "freefalling" to the studded blue bottom. With the way my pool was fashioned, there were many exhilarating diving spots and no way back out. So, about three times a week I would wake up and head out with a pool net. Sometimes they would resist being pulled out and quickly leap back in, but most often than not they were satisfied with their swim and ready to head back home. For this reason I blame toads for my initial fascination with them, much less myself. I never would have sought them out had it not been for their early morning escapades.  
        </p>
        
    <h3 align="center"> Distinguishing Froggy boys from Toady lads</h3>
    
    <p> Toads do not exist. There are only frogs and nothing more. Toads are an illusion sent out by the American Postal Service to misguide you. You will certainly not find a link to a toad site on this page, especially not near the top, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad">toads do not exist</a> (technically they're just frogs).</p>

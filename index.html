    <p> How I adore frogs! They rush and scramble through the yellow bushes in front of my house; barely can I keep up with them. Many a night I spent chasing their croaks and wheezes, only to be greeted by silence and moist earth. Occasionally, as I scale the hills in front of my home, I find their bleached skeletons; it does me a great deal of pain to see them. For the ones I find alive, their wart-covered and squishy bodies keep my hands at bay. I'm content with watching them slip around. A bit of a tangent, but I've only ever seen them in the evening or at night (one such frog was deformed and living underneath a plastic pond someone put out). Of course you would assume this to be reasonable-frogs are quite pleased with cooler light. For quite a few years I assumed the same! Yet a tiny yellowish frog I met was more than eager to skitter around in the morning. I often checked up on him in his little frontyard hole. He made me question the limits of frogs, their personalities even! I should begin naming the ones I find. For instance, there was one large frog I discovered in a gorge one day, next to an abandoned plane part. He was a beauty, I was completely immersed in his Jovian eyes and matte-green back. I named him 'Toasty,' partly because he gave off a toasty vibe and partly because I stared at him for so long I forgot about my toaster being on back at home and arrived to a black chunk of inedible ash (formerly wheat bread).

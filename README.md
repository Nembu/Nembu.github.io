# Nembu.github.io

This is just a test for my lackluster skills. I'll improve it every day I can, just keeping to a schedule and adding to it.
I've never used Github much so this will also be a way for me to learn.

P.S This website has turned into a tinii frogii blogii (a frog blog with frog pictures galore).
P.P.S I keep forgetting to update the code here since I work in brackets, so I'll update everything every Friday.

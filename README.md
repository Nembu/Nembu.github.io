////////////The Frog Blog will be covered by something else for the time being///////////////////
P.S This website has turned into a frog blog with frog pictures galore, except for the fact that I've deceived you and they're actually mostly toads. You can find a hidden link to a "Load a Toad" website near the top of the webpage, or just look really carefully at the screen for a light gray link against the near-white background).
P.P.S I keep forgetting to update the code here since I work in brackets (and APs are killing me).
